        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have lived in London for about 10 years where I worked as a Property Manager together with my wife, Emilia. 5 years ago, tired of the climate in London, we decided to live in Rome, the city where we got married and I was born. Having always been a computer lover, precisely a year ago, I have dedicated myself to developing websites through the WordPress platform. To date I have created some projects, and I would like to deepen my knowledge as a Web Developer.

        <h2>Pallino, the neighbourhood cat</h2>
        <p>In the profile photo I present Pallino. Pallino is the neighborhood cat loved by everyone. He lives in the corner of our building and has the peculiar characteristic of emitting a very powerful and plaintive Meow, this is his declaration that he is hungry. Surely someone will come down from our building or the one opposite to feed him.
          He never quarrels with anyone, the dogs stop and smell him. He has only a few problems with the seagulls and the rattles who sometimes want to steal food from him. This explains the injury he had recently. But now everything is fine, Pallino has been taken to the vet, treated and ready to Meow again.</p>
