        <h2>About Pallino</h2>

       <p>
           In the profile photo I present Pallino. Pallino is the neighborhood cat loved by everyone. He lives in the corner of our building and has the peculiar characteristic of emitting a very powerful and plaintive Meow, this is his declaration that he is hungry. Surely someone will come down from our building or the one opposite to feed him.
        He never quarrels with anyone, the dogs stop and smell him. He has only a few problems with the seagulls and the rattles who sometimes want to steal food from him. This explains the injury he had recently. But now everything is fine, Pallino has been taken to the vet, treated and ready to Meow again.
